 Term Project - Neha and Yuwei 
 
 1. The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal?

    The primary purpose of our project will be to predict stock prices and make recommendations to a user. Specifically, we hope to gather input data from the user including information regarding their preferences, industries of interest, the amount available to invest, etc, and then utilize this data along with our price predictions to make recommendations to the user. Our project would primarily be geared toward people who are first-time investors or new to the investing world. Our minimal viable product would be to create a program that performs the stated function, and our stretch goal would be to create an appealing/attractive UI for the program to make it more user-friendly. 


2. Learning Goals: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.

    Through this project, we both have the shared general goal of understanding how the development and problem-solving process works in a group setting, meaning how we are able to combine our ideas, program, and compile assets together, etc. Individually, we both hope to continue to learn more about the field of data science within the context of problem-solving, specific libraries like pandas and numpy, and to continue to become stronger programmers in general.


3. Implementation Plan: this will probably be pretty vague initially. Perhaps at this early juncture you will have identified a library or a framework that you think will be useful for your project. If you don't have any idea how you will implement your project, provide a rough plan for how you will determine this information.

    -These library/framework will be used for data structure: Numpy; pandasâ€™ quantdsl; statistics; 

    -There library/framework will be used for calculating the Pricing: PyQL; pyfin; vollib; QuantPy; Finance-Python; ffn; pynance; tia; hasura; finta; Tulipy

    -These library/framework will be used for calendars: trading_calendars; bizdays; and pandas_market_calendars

    -These library/framework will be used for obtaining data: findatapy; googlefinance; yahoo-finance; pandas-datareader; pandas-finance

    -These library/framework will be for visualization: D-Tale


4. Project schedule: You have 8 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Sketch out a rough schedule for completing the project. Depending on your project, you may be able to do this in great specificity or you may only be able to give a broad outline. Additionally, longer projects come with increased uncertainty, and this schedule will likely need to be refined along the way.
